            <h1 class="margin text-center">CYOA Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>With my partner, we were prompted to create a fun adventure project together, with the goal of practicing our linking between pages. The title of my project was "A trip to Mcdonalds", which was meant to simulate someone deciding whether to eat Mcdonalds or eat at home for the day.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>For our project, we first needed to create a diagram plan to determine what file links to what file. We divided the work between 2 subdirectories- whether to eat at Mcdonalds or eat at home and then starting working on a repo in markdown until eventually making html copies of the original files  as well as a style CSS file for extra credit. This project provides an interactive fun storyline where you can play and decide what actions to commit to.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>My teacher- Mr. Mueller assigned this project to us so that not only can we practice collaborating with other people we may not know very well or do not want to work with, but to also practice linking from one page to another. </p>
            <p>One thing that was kind of difficult about this project was communication since I haven't been able to attend class in person during the timeframe of this project for personal reasons. I had to contact my partner remotely on Slack which was succesful, but thinking about how to communicate properly was a challenge for me in the beginning. I took away that Slack is very useful no matter the situation.</p>
            <p>Additionally, another challenge for me was thinking about how to style the CSS of my page for the extra credit. I tried to make my CSS a bit simple, but I impulsively tried to learn a new CSS concept (CSS flexbox) that was meant to be learnt from our upcoming Freedom Project because I was being picky and didn't like the way my page looked. Trying to learn this concept within a short period of time was challenging, and so I learned that I should not only manage my time a bit better but to throughly plan things out.</p>
            <p>Next time I would definitely work more on the CSS of my page to make it more appealing and fun if I had more time, since I used the exact same CSS for every page. Adding more images and visual details would've been fun to do with more time.</p>
