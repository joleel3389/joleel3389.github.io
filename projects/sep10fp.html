            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP10 freedom project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>My "Badminton SEP10 project" was my year long project where the task was to research about a chosen topic (to which I chose badminton), including present innovations and future possible innovations. My goal of making this website to inform others of current technologies in badminton as well as my future ideas. </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>I made this project on existing software and hardware technologies of badminton, while also proposing ideas for future innovations of badminton. This meant that I needed to research on the existing technologies for badminton myself, so that I could inform others of the already existing technologies, and also use current innovations to help me think of creative new innovations that don't exist. Additionally, for my website I independently learned a tool (to which I chose flexbox) to help make my website. Other than flexbox, for my website I mainly used HTML, CSS, bootstrap which we've actively been learning within one year at SEP10.  </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>For my project, there were some minor challenges that I faced when making it. I learned how to utilize my peer feedback, utilize media queries, and track what I learned efficiently.</p>
            <p>For instance, one challenge I had was making sure my website had good readability. Before, over the darker backgrounds on my page, the description text font colors blended in to the background too much, and was very hard to read. My peers gave me feedback on this, and suggested that I changed this color so it'd be much more readable. And so, I did just that, turning the old greyish color to a lighter slightly greenish grey shade. With peer feedback, I was able to recognize this flaw in my website, and took proper action to fix it. From this, I took away that you should be more considerate of your users, and with that you should always consider peer feedback to help improve your website.</p>
            <p>Another challenge I had was making my website more responsive. At first, I didn't take advantage really of media queries, and so I only tried to use one for my context image in particular. On my website, my context image used to have a wonky ratio each time someone would adjust the screensize from one breakpoint to another. In other words, it didn't fee very consistent or smooth. Hence, I then tried to use more than one media query, with one for each breakpoint to ensure the image will indeed look appealing at each breakpoint/every screen size and it'll look consistent and smooth when transitioning from one screen size to another. From this, I took away that I should utilize media queries for the most responsiveness on my website.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I learned that tracking down your learning is useful. It is a general challenge for me to remember things, and so when I utilized the learning log we were assigned to do once every week, it helped me track my learning even further. I used my learning log every day until I finished learning all properties of my freedom project tool, which helped me immensely when I wanted to look back on properties of my tool I could've used.</p>
